<h1>Yan Yang – Aspiring Researcher Preparing for Doctoral Work</h1>

<p>
I am an independent researcher with graduate-level training in computer science, previous experience as a Machine Learning R&D Engineer at Deepcell Inc., and research coursework from KAUST (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology). I am currently developing proposals and preparing for doctoral applications.
</p>

<p>
My research focuses on modeling complexity in human behavior, particularly emotion and motivation, using tools from machine learning and informatics. I am especially interested in affective computing, algorithmic representations of mental states, and interdisciplinary connections across neuroscience, cognitive science, and social science.
</p>

<p>
I am open to collaborative opportunities and academic mentorship, and actively seeking PhD and research positions in the United States, Canada, Europe, and other regions.
